## How to contribute

If you're a member of the Hexahedronic organization, you have write access already.
Otherwise, send us a pull request. A developer will review it and decide whether to pull it or not.

## Guidelines

If you want your pull request to be accepted:

- Please try to stick to our code style. Code that is too different will not be merged until it is fixed.

- Please avoid using spaces for indentation.

- Please follow our directory structure.

Members of the organization are also expected to follow these guidelines.

## What if my pull request is denied?

Does your code style bear any resemblance to ours? If not, please fix that.

Troll pullreqs are obviously denied.
